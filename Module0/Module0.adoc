= Introduction to Cyber-Physical Systems

== Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Overview

*Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)* are integrated systems that combine computational (cyber) and physical elements to interact with the real world in real time. These systems use sensors, actuators, networks, and software to monitor and control physical processes. CPS are designed to process data, make decisions, and execute actions, often autonomously or with minimal human intervention.
These systems are comprised of four components:

- Physical Components
- Computational Components
- Network and Communication Components
- Feedback Loop and Automation Components 

=== 1. Physical Components
*Purpose*: These are the real-world elements of the system that interact with the environment and perform physical actions.

*Key Elements*::
- *Sensors*: Devices that collect real-time data from the environment (e.g., temperature, motion, pressure sensors).
- *Actuators*: Devices that take actions based on commands from the computational components (e.g., motors, valves, robotic arms).
- *Machines and Equipment*: Physical infrastructure like vehicles, robots, or industrial machines that are controlled by CPS.

*Examples*::
- In autonomous vehicles, physical components include cameras, LiDAR sensors, and braking systems.
- In smart grids, sensors monitor electricity usage and control power distribution.

=== 2. Computational Components
*Purpose*: These components handle computation associated with data processing, state estimation, and decision making/control algorithms.

*Key Elements*::
- *Data Processing Units*: Microprocessors, GPUs, FPGAs, or cloud servers that receive data from sensors and perform computations.
- *Algorithms*: Algorithms that analyze sensor data using signal processing and state estimation, and make decisions or perform control.

*Examples*::
- In healthcare, a CPS might analyze patient vital signs to detect abnormalities and trigger medical alerts.

=== 3. Network and Communication Components
*Purpose*: These enable communication between physical components and computational systems, often in real-time.

*Key Elements*::
- *Wired and Wireless Networks*: Communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, 5G, ZigBee, and Ethernet that facilitate data exchange between sensors, actuators, and control systems.
- *Gateways and Routers*: Devices that manage data traffic between local devices and central or cloud-based systems.

- In autonomous drones, 5G networks ensure low-latency communication for remote control and data streaming.

=== 4. Feedback and Automation Components
*Purpose*: These components enable continuous monitoring and automated responses to changing conditions, forming a feedback loop between physical and computational layers.

*Key Elements*::
- *Feedback Loop*: Data from sensors is continuously fed back to the computational systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to actuator commands.
- *Automated Control*: Systems can automatically adjust parameters based on real-time data (e.g., adjusting temperature, speed, or pressure).
- *Self-Optimization and Learning*: Some CPS incorporate AI to learn from feedback data and optimize performance over time.

*Examples*::
- In smart manufacturing, CPS systems automatically adjust machine operations based on sensor feedback to optimize production efficiency.
- In smart cities, traffic signals adjust in real time based on traffic flow data from sensors to optimize vehicle movement and reduce congestion.

CPS integrates these four critical components to create systems that are responsive, intelligent, and capable of real-time interaction with the physical world. By combining these components, CPS can operate autonomously or semi-autonomously in applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart factories, and smart healthcare systems.

=== Key Characteristics of CPS:

1. *Integration of Physical and Cyber Components*: CPS involves the tight integration of physical processes with computational algorithms, where each influences the other.
2. *Real-Time Control and Monitoring*: Sensors collect data from the physical environment, which is processed and analyzed by computational systems to make real-time decisions.
3. *Feedback Loops*: Data is continuously exchanged between the physical and cyber components to adjust actions based on environmental changes.
4. *Autonomy and Automation*: Many CPS operate autonomously, performing complex tasks with little human involvement.

=== Common Examples of CPS:
- *Smart Grids*: Real-time monitoring and control of electricity distribution networks.
- *Autonomous Vehicles*: Cars equipped with sensors and AI to drive and navigate without human intervention.
- *Industrial Automation*: Systems that control and monitor factory operations, improving efficiency and safety.
- *Smart Buildings*: Buildings equipped with systems that automatically control heating, lighting, and security based on real-time conditions.

CPS are foundational to many modern innovations, particularly in areas like *Industry 4.0*, *smart cities*, *healthcare*, *transportation*, and *robotics*, where real-time data and control are essential.

== The Importance of Abstraction in CPS

*Abstraction* in the context of cyber-physical systems (CPS) refers to simplifying complex systems by representing them in different levels of detail, focusing on the essential aspects that are relevant to a particular analysis or task while ignoring irrelevant details. This layered approach helps manage the complexity of CPS, which involves tightly integrated physical processes and computational components.

=== 1. Physical System Abstraction
The physical components of CPS (e.g., sensors, actuators, machines) are abstracted as models that represent their behavior, dynamics, and interactions with the environment. For example, instead of working directly with a physical robot, engineers may create a mathematical model of its movements, which simplifies real-world testing and analysis.

This abstraction allows developers to focus on the system's key physical behaviors without needing to work directly with all the details of the hardware at every stage.

=== 2. Computation Abstraction
Computational elements, such as embedded controllers, communication protocols, and software, are also abstracted. Instead of dealing with the complexity of real-time code execution and data management, higher-level abstractions (such as models or flowcharts) allow developers to design, simulate, and analyze the software before it is implemented.

This layer typically abstracts computation into tasks, algorithms, or services, allowing developers to focus on the behavior of the software, ensuring it interacts properly with the physical system.

=== 3. Communication Abstraction
Communication in CPS, such as data exchange between sensors, actuators, and control systems, can be abstracted to focus on how information flows through the system rather than the intricate details of network protocols. As long as two components share a similar communication interface, their interactions can be abstracted to concepts such data exchange and transmission rates, while ignoring complexity such as encryption, transmission reliability, or session management.

This allows designers to model and simulate data flow and message exchanges at a high level, ensuring that critical information is shared in a timely and efficient manner without getting bogged down in low-level details like packet switching or error detection.

=== 4. Control Abstraction
Control systems in CPS (like feedback loops or decision-making algorithms) are often abstracted through models such as state machines, control theory diagrams, or optimization algorithms. These models allow designers to evaluate how the system responds to various inputs and disturbances, focusing on system stability, efficiency, or responsiveness without directly interacting with hardware controllers.

At a higher abstraction, developers might focus on control objectives (like maintaining temperature or position) rather than the specifics of sensor inputs and motor outputs.

=== 5. Hierarchical Abstraction (Layered Approach)
CPS is typically broken down into multiple layers, with each layer representing a different level of abstraction. For instance, in a smart factory, you may have:
- *Device Level:* Individual sensors and actuators.
- *Control Level:* Embedded systems and local controllers.
- *System Level:* Integration of multiple devices into subsystems (e.g., robotic arms).
- *Enterprise Level:* Coordination and optimization of entire systems (e.g., supply chain management).

Each level abstracts the details of the lower levels, allowing engineers to focus on specific aspects of the system relevant to their tasks.

=== 6. Abstraction for Cross-Domain Integration
Cyber-physical systems often integrate across multiple domains (e.g., mechanical, electrical, software). Abstraction allows for different domain experts (such as software engineers, mechanical engineers, and network specialists) to work on their respective parts of the system without needing full knowledge of every domain.

For example, a mechanical engineer can work with an abstract representation of control algorithms, while a software engineer focuses on designing efficient code, both abstracting away details of the other domain.

=== Benefits of Abstraction in CPS
- *Simplified Design:* By focusing only on the most relevant aspects at each level, developers can manage the complexity of CPS without being overwhelmed by details.
- *Scalability:* Abstraction allows systems to scale, as engineers can work on different subsystems or components without losing sight of the bigger picture.
- *Modularity:* Components of the system can be abstracted and treated as modular units, which can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
- *Simulation and Testing:* Abstractions allow for early-stage simulation and testing without needing the complete physical system, saving time and resources.

In Summary::
Abstraction in CPS helps to manage complexity, allowing engineers to design, simulate, and optimize systems at different levels without being overwhelmed by the intricate details of physical, computational, and communication processes. This makes it easier to integrate and manage the cyber and physical components of CPS effectively.

== System Of Systems (SoS)

A *System of Systems (SoS)* refers to a collection of independent systems that collaborate or interact with one another to achieve a common goal. Each individual system within the SoS is typically capable of operating on its own to achieve its own objective, but when combined with other systems, they form a more complex, interconnected, and higher-functioning system. In the context of CSP, these systems of systems have specific characteristics that are important to identify.

=== Key Characteristics of a System of Systems (SoS):

1. *Modularity of Subsystems (Referential Transparency):*
   The individual systems within a SoS are autonomous, meaning they are capable of functioning independently. Each subsystem is capable of meeting its own system requirements. Even though these systems work together, they retain the ability to operate independently and fulfill their own goals. If the larger SoS breaks down, the individual systems can continue to function.

2. *Managerial Independence:*
   Each system is typically managed independently, with its own computational component. This means that each subsystem should have its own state machine, feedback control loop, or local objective, making coordination within the SoS challenging but necessary for achieving higher-level objectives.

3. *Emergent Behavior:*
   CPS SoS often exhibit emergent behavior, which means that new functionalities or capabilities arise that are not present in the individual systems alone. For example, imagine multiple sensors are communicating with a centralized computer. If one sensor is transmitting data that requires a longer time to process computationally, the computer might drop messages from other sensors in the mean time, limiting the systems capabilities.

4. *Evolutionary Development:*
   CPS SoS evolve over time as new subsystems are integrated or existing subsystems are modified or removed. They are dynamic and can adapt to new requirements, technologies, and environmental changes. This requires well defined interfaces, and strictly enforced subsystem performance requirements.

=== Example of Systems of Systems:

Imagine the following CSP. A graduate student has trouble keeping their house plant a live so they design a water system with the following features:
. A soil moisture sensor is placed in the pot and is connected to a Raspberry pi via I2C. 
. If the moisture levels are below a defined threshold, the Raspberry pi can add water the the plant.
. To water the plant, the Raspberry pi generates a digital signal that engages a motor driver, turning on a stepper motor driven water pump.
. The Raspberry pi is connected via wifi to a the internet, and uses HTTPS to determine the user-defined moisture level threshold.
. If the graduate student notices that their plant is looking a little wilted, they lower the threshold using a website on their smartphone to increase the frequency of watering. 

1. *Modularity of Subsystems (Referential Transparency):*
   If the Raspberry pi failed, the soil sensor would still function to meet its own subsystem requirements: to generate readings of the soil moisture, even if the overall system failed. Note, to generate 12C messages, the sensor must have its own micro processor. This makes the sensor a cyber-physical system in and of itself.

2. *Managerial Independence:*
   The feedback control loop for the stepper motor is independent of the overall system feedback loop for keeping the plant watered. 

3. *Emergent Behavior:*
   Image that the water pump outlet was set too close to the soil sensor. When moisture levels are too low, the pump is engaged and pour water directly onto the sensor. This immediately raises sensor readings, turning off the water pump. This can result in unexpected jittering or failure to keep the plant water, due to an unexpected interaction between the sensor and the actuator. Perhaps placing the sensor and the pump outlet on opposite sides of the pot will address this issue.

4. *Evolutionary Development:*
   A year later, a new-and-improved soil moisture sensor is released. As long as this new sensor uses I2C and generates values in the same range and with the same or better accuracy as the previous sensor, no extra work is needed to replace the old sensor with the newer model.

=== Challenges in Systems of Systems:
- *Coordination:* Managing interactions between independently operated systems is complex and requires effective communication protocols and interoperability.
- *Security:* SoS involve multiple systems that may have varying levels of security, making the overall system vulnerable if any single component is compromised.
- *Emergent Behavior Management:* The behavior that emerges from system interactions can sometimes be unpredictable or undesirable, requiring continuous monitoring and adjustment.

=== Benefits of Systems of Systems:
- *Scalability and Flexibility:* SoS can scale by adding new independent systems without disrupting existing ones. They are also flexible, as individual systems can evolve or be replaced without requiring a complete overhaul of the larger system.
- *Enhanced Capabilities:* SoS provide functionality that would not be possible with isolated systems. By working together, they can solve more complex problems and deliver higher-level services.
- *Resilience:* SoS are often more resilient because the failure of one system may not cripple the entire system, as other systems can continue functioning independently.

=== In Summary:
A *System of Systems (SoS)* is an integration of independent, autonomous systems that work together to achieve a common goal while maintaining their individual functionality and independence. Many components that appear to be a sensor, actuator, or computer, can be a cyber-physical system in and of itself. They offer scalability, flexibility, and enhanced capabilities but also present challenges related to coordination, security, and governance.

== CPS Architectures and Frameworks
There are many high level architectures that can be used to describe the design, function, and operation of cyber-physical systems. The most common are:

. 3C Architecture
. 5C Architecture 
. IoT-A (Internet of Things Architecture)
. NIST Architecture
. Edge/Fog/Cloud Framework
. Digital Twin Framework

These architectures provide a framework that can be used to understand the taxonomy of a cyber-physical system. No single framework is better in all cases, but selecting the correct framework to understand your system can help provide insight, structure, and uniformity when working on complex systems with large teams of engineers.

=== Digital Twin Framework

A *digital twin* is a highly detailed virtual model of a physical object, system, or process, continuously updated with real-time data to reflect its real-world counterpart's state and behavior. This connection enables organizations to monitor, simulate, and analyze the performance of the physical entity throughout its entire lifecycle, from design and development to operation and maintenance.

A digital twin acts as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds, providing an up-to-date, dynamic model that can be used for monitoring, simulation, and optimization. By offering real-time insights and predictive analytics, digital twins help organizations enhance performance, improve reliability, and reduce costs.

==== Key Components of a Digital Twin:
1. *Physical Entity:* The actual object or system being represented, such as a machine, building, or even a person.
2. *Virtual Model:* A digital replica that mirrors the physical entity. This model is typically constructed using advanced simulations, algorithms, machine learning, and real-time data from sensors attached to the physical object.
3. *Data Flow:* Continuous data exchange between the physical and virtual twin, enabled by sensors, networks, and IoT devices. This data includes real-time performance metrics, environmental conditions, and historical data.

==== How a Digital Twin Works:
The digital twin continuously synchronizes with its physical counterpart through sensors and connected devices, capturing real-time data on various parameters like temperature, pressure, or movement. This data is fed into the virtual model, enabling it to reflect the current state of the physical object. Advanced algorithms and simulations within the digital twin allow it to:

- *Monitor:* Track the real-time status and performance of the physical object.
- *Simulate:* Predict future states based on current conditions, run “what-if” scenarios, and evaluate potential outcomes.
- *Analyze:* Identify potential issues or inefficiencies, offering insights for optimization.
- *Optimize:* Provide recommendations for improving performance or preemptively address maintenance needs.

==== Benefits of Digital Twins:
- *Predictive Maintenance:* By continuously monitoring the physical object, digital twins can predict when components will fail, allowing for maintenance to be scheduled proactively, reducing downtime.
- *Improved Design & Testing:* During the design phase, engineers can use the digital twin to simulate different conditions and designs, reducing the need for physical prototypes and testing.
- *Operational Efficiency:* Real-time insights allow organizations to optimize operations by making informed decisions about performance, energy usage, and resource allocation.
- *Enhanced Decision-Making:* Digital twins enable data-driven decision-making, as they provide a comprehensive view of the current state, future potential issues, and opportunities for improvement.

==== Use Cases:
- *Manufacturing:* Digital twins of production lines allow manufacturers to simulate and optimize factory processes, reducing waste and improving productivity.
