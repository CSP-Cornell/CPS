== Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** 7-layer model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols interact in a communication system. Each layer in the OSI model represents a specific function within the data communication process.

=== The 7-Layer OSI Networking Hierarchy

1. *Physical Layer*
- *Function*: The Physical layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices. It deals with the transmission and reception of raw binary data (bits) over a communication medium such as cables, fiber optics, or radio waves.

|===

The OSI model serves as a theoretical framework. In practice, many protocols span multiple layers. For example, the **TCP/IP model**, commonly used in modern networking, combines some layers (e.g., Presentation and Application layers into one). Nonetheless, the OSI model is a useful way to understand how data moves through a network and how different protocols work together to ensure communication.

=== OSI in Practice

The following example demonstrates how each layer of the **OSI model** is used when a user accesses a website via a browser. The data flows through each layer to ensure successful transmission and reception.

1. *Physical Layer*
- *Function*: The Physical layer transmits raw binary data over the physical medium, such as Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi signals.
- *Example*: The network adapter (e.g., Ethernet port or Wi-Fi chip) on your computer sends electrical or radio signals representing bits across the network. The connection could be made through a cable or over a wireless network.

2. *Data Link Layer*
- *Function*: The Data Link layer creates frames and handles error detection and correction for data transmitted within the local network.
- *Example*: Your computer's MAC address is used to identify it on the local network. The router uses your MAC address to direct the request to the next point in the network. Data is encapsulated into Ethernet frames for transmission within the local area network (LAN).

3. *Network Layer*
- *Function*: The Network layer manages IP addressing and routing, determining the best path for data to travel across different networks.
- *Example*: The router identifies your computer's IP address and uses it to route your request to the web server hosting the website. The data is broken into packets and forwarded to the web server through the internet.

4. *Transport Layer*
- *Function*: The Transport layer ensures reliable data transfer, error recovery, and flow control, splitting data into segments.
- *Example*: **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) breaks your HTTP request into segments and ensures that the segments are delivered in the correct order to the web server. It also handles retransmission if any segments are lost during transmission.

5. *Session Layer*
- *Function*: The Session layer manages and maintains the communication session between the client (your browser) and the server.
- *Example*: When you open a connection to the web server (via HTTP), the session layer manages the communication session, ensuring that it stays open while you browse and closes it when you're done.

6. *Presentation Layer*
- *Function*: The Presentation layer translates data between the application and network formats, handling encryption and data formatting.
- *Example*: If the website uses **HTTPS**, SSL/TLS encryption is applied here, ensuring that sensitive information is encrypted before it is transmitted over the network. Data is also compressed or formatted for efficient transmission.

7. *Application Layer*
- *Function*: The Application layer provides services directly to end-user applications, enabling interaction between applications and the network.
- *Example*: **HTTP** at the Application layer governs the exchange of web content. When you enter a URL, the browser sends an **HTTP GET request** to the web server. The server responds with HTML content, which your browser renders as a webpage.

*Explanation of the End-to-End Process*
When a user enters a URL into a browser, the browser (Application layer) sends an HTTP request to the web server. The data is encrypted (Presentation layer), and the session is established (Session layer). The transport protocol (Transport layer) breaks the data into segments for transmission. The Network layer divides it into packets, which are encapsulated into frames (Data Link layer) and sent as signals (Physical layer). The server responds by reversing this process, ensuring successful communication.

== Fundamental Concepts in Wired Communication Protocols

1. *Signal Transmission* (Analog vs. Digital)
- Data is transmitted through electrical signals.
- *Analog*: Continuous signal variation.
    ** Advantages
        *** Can represent a wider range of values, making it suitable for audio and video signals.
        *** Often simpler and more intuitive for real-world applications like voice transmission.
    ** Disadvantages 
        *** More susceptible to noise and signal degradation over distance.
        *** Harder to process, store, and recover accurately compared to digital signals.
- *Digital*: Discrete voltage levels represent 1s and 0s.
    ** Advantages
        *** More resistant to noise, allowing for clearer signals over long distances.
        *** Easier to encrypt, compress, and correct errors in transmission.
        *** Allows for greater data processing and storage efficiency.
    ** Disadvantages
        *** Requires more bandwidth for the same amount of data compared to analog.
        *** Can be more complex and expensive to implement, especially in high-speed systems.

2. *Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication*
- *Synchronous*: Devices use a shared clock to synchronize data transfer (e.g., SPI).
    ** Faster, but requires clock lines.
- *Asynchronous*: No shared clock. Uses start/stop bits to mark data transmission (e.g., UART).
    ** More flexible but slower due to additional bits.

3. *Baud Rate vs. Bit Rate*
- *Baud rate*: Number of signal changes (symbols) per second.
- *Bit rate*: Number of bits transmitted per second.
- May differ if complex encoding is used.

4. *Duplexing* (Half-duplex vs. Full-duplex)
- *Half-duplex*: Data flows in both directions, but not simultaneously (e.g., RS-485).
- *Full-duplex*: Simultaneous bidirectional data flow (e.g., Ethernet, SPI with separate lines).

5. *Bus Topology & Communication*
- Multiple devices share the same data lines.
- *Single-master* (e.g., I²C) vs. *multi-master* systems (e.g., CAN).
- Arbitration and bus contention are key in shared communication environments.

6. *Addressing & Device Identification*
- Each device must have an address in shared communication systems.
- *Static* vs. *dynamic addressing*: Defines how devices are identified.

7. *Error Detection & Correction*
- Errors are common in communication; systems must detect and correct them.
- Techniques include *parity bits*, *checksums*, and *CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)*.
- Ensures data integrity, especially in critical applications.

8. *Electrical Characteristics* (Pull-up/Pull-down Resistors)
- *Pull-up/pull-down resistors* define logic levels when no active signal is present.
- Important in open-drain/open-collector configurations (e.g., I²C).
- Helps prevent floating pins and ensures signal stability.
- *Selecting Resistor Value*
    ** *Large Values*: reduce power consumption and noise sensitivity, but reduce rise time and reduce maximum communication speeds
    ** *Small Values*: increase rise time and communication speeds, but also increase power consumption and noise sensitivity
    ** Key considerations:
        *** Bus capacitance (affected by the length of the wires and number of devices)
        *** Desired clock speed
        *** Operating Voltage

9. *Framing & Data Packets*
- Data is transmitted in structured frames or packets.
- Components include start/stop bits, headers, payloads, and error-check fields.
- Relevant in protocols like CAN and Ethernet for managing data streams and preventing collisions.

10. *Protocol Layering & Abstraction*
- Different communication protocols work at different layers of a system, with each layer adding additional functionality such as error correction, encryption, etc. 
- Each layer is able to ignore all previous layers and assume the previously layers' functionality.
- Relates to the OSI model (e.g., Ethernet at the data link layer, TCP/IP at the network layer).

== Considerations for Reducing Electro-Magnetic Interference 

1. *Twisted Pair Cabling*
- *Why it helps*: Twisting the wires helps cancel out electromagnetic interference, as noise affects both wires equally, and the interference is neutralized when the signals are combined.

2. *Shielded Cables*
- *Why it helps*: Shielding cables with a conductive layer (usually braided or foil) helps block external electromagnetic fields from penetrating and interfering with the signal.

3. *Grounding*
- *Why it helps*: Proper grounding helps protect communication lines from voltage spikes, reduces the potential difference that can cause noise, and drains excess noise from the environment.
- *Key tips*: Ensure that the shield (if using shielded cables) is grounded at one end, and avoid ground loops, which can introduce noise instead of reducing it.

4. *Cable Routing*
- *Why it helps*: Positioning communication cables away from sources of EMI (like power cables, motors, or high-frequency devices) minimizes the likelihood of noise induction.
- *Key tips*: Keep data cables as short as possible, and avoid running them parallel to power lines. If necessary, cross them at right angles to reduce exposure to magnetic fields.

5. *Differential Signaling*
- *Why it helps*: Differential signaling transmits signals across two wires, with one wire carrying the inverse of the other. This reduces the impact of common-mode noise, as interference affects both wires equally and can be canceled out.

6. *Use of Termination Resistors*
- *Why it helps*: Termination resistors at the ends of transmission lines (particularly for high-speed or long-distance communication) help prevent signal reflections, which can degrade signal quality and introduce noise.

7. *Electrical Design*
- *Ferrite Beads*
    ** *Why it helps*: Ferrite beads act as low-pass filters, absorbing high-frequency noise from the communication lines and reducing EMI. They help suppress transient noise that may enter the circuit.
    ** *Use cases*: Commonly placed on power lines or data lines in sensitive systems like USB or Ethernet networks.
- *Capacitors*
    ** *Why it helps*: Placing decoupling capacitors across power and ground lines of communication components helps filter out high-frequency noise.
    ** *Key tips*: Use small-value capacitors (e.g., 0.1 µF) near communication ICs to filter noise from power supply lines.

=== Summary of Key Considerations:
- Twisted pair and shielded cables reduce EMI exposure.
- Grounding and proper cable routing minimize noise and interference.
- Differential signaling and termination resistors improve noise immunity and signal quality.
- Ferrite beads and decoupling capacitors help filter high-frequency noise.
- Slower signal transitions, lower frequencies, and good PCB design help in reducing EMI and ensuring reliable communication.

== Wireless Communication Protocols 

=== Wireless Communication Overview

The choice of electromagnetic frequency band for wireless communication depends on the specific application, considering factors like range, data rate, and susceptibility to interference. Lower frequencies (below 1 GHz) are favored for long-range communication with low power consumption, while higher frequencies (like SHF and EHF) provide much faster data rates but are limited in range and line-of-sight. ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands are widely used for consumer electronics due to their unlicensed nature.

=== Wifi

Wi-Fi is a wireless communication technology that allows devices to connect to a local area network (LAN) using radio waves, providing wireless internet access and data sharing within a specific area. Wi-Fi operates under the IEEE 802.11 standards and is widely used in homes, offices, public places, and businesses to enable wireless networking.

==== Key Characteristics
- *Frequency Band*: WiFi can operate in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) bands.
- *Range*: WiFI devices typically have a range of 30–50 meters indoors, up to 100+ meters outdoors depending on the standard.
- *Data Rates*: From 11 Mbps (802.11b) to 9.6 Gbps (Wi-Fi 6, 802.11ax)
- *Topology*: Supports star (infrastructure), peer-to-peer (ad-hoc), and mesh networks to cover a large area.

==== How Wi-Fi Works
1. *Wireless Access Points (WAPs)*:
   - A Wi-Fi network is typically created by a *wireless access point (AP)* or *router*, which transmits and receives data using radio waves.
   - Devices (clients) like smartphones, laptops, and tablets communicate with the access point, which acts as a bridge to the wired network or the internet.

2. *Radio Waves*:
   - Wi-Fi operates on radio frequencies in the *2.4 GHz* and *5 GHz* bands. Newer Wi-Fi versions, such as Wi-Fi 6E, also operate in the *6 GHz* band.
   - The radio signal from the router can be picked up by any device within range that has a Wi-Fi adapter.

3. *SSID (Service Set Identifier)*:
   - Wi-Fi networks are identified by an *SSID*, which is the network name that devices use to connect to the access point.
   - A user can select the SSID from a list of available networks and enter a password (if security is enabled) to connect.

4. *Data Transmission*:
   - Wi-Fi uses a modulation technique called *Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)* to transmit data efficiently over different frequencies.
   - Data is broken into smaller packets and transmitted wirelessly between devices and the access point.

5. *Security*:
   - Wi-Fi networks are secured using various encryption methods to protect the data being transmitted. Common security protocols include:
     * *WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)*: Older and less secure.
     * *WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)*: More secure than WEP but has been replaced by WPA2.
     * *WPA2 and WPA3*: The current standard for securing Wi-Fi networks, with WPA3 offering the latest improvements in encryption and security.

==== Wi-Fi Standards

Wi-Fi operates under a family of IEEE 802.11 standards. The most common ones are:

- *802.11b* (1999):

  * Introduces technologies like Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Target Wake Time (TWT) for efficiency in dense environments.

==== Key Features of Wi-Fi

1. *Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance* (CSMA/CA)
- CSMA/CA is a network protocol used in Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 standards) to manage how devices share the wireless medium and avoid collisions when transmitting data. 
- In Wi-Fi, CSMA/CA prevents data collisions by having devices "listen" to the channel before transmitting. 
- If the channel is busy, the device waits for a random backoff period before trying again. 
- Once the channel is clear, the device transmits data, and the receiving device sends an acknowledgment (ACK) to confirm receipt. 
- If no ACK is received, the data is retransmitted.

2. *Multiple Input, Multiple Output* (MIMO)
- MIMO is a technology that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to send and receive multiple data streams simultaneously. 
- This increases the data throughput and improves signal reliability, especially in environments with obstacles or interference. 
- MIMO is commonly used in Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) and later standards.

3. *Beamforming*
- Beamforming focuses the Wi-Fi signal in the direction of the connected device, rather than broadcasting it in all directions. 
- This improves signal strength, range, and data rates by directing energy toward the device, reducing interference and enhancing overall performance. 
- Beamforming is supported in Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax).

4. *Mesh Networking*
- Mesh networking uses multiple access points (nodes) that work together to provide seamless Wi-Fi coverage across larger areas. 
- In a mesh network, devices can automatically switch between nodes for the best connection, making it ideal for large homes, offices, or outdoor spaces. 
- This reduces dead zones and enhances Wi-Fi performance.

5. *Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access* (OFDMA)
- OFDMA is a Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) feature that divides the wireless channel into smaller subchannels, allowing multiple devices to share the same channel simultaneously. 
- This improves efficiency, reduces latency, and optimizes performance in environments with many connected devices, such as offices or public hotspots.

==== Advantages of Wi-Fi
- *Convenience*: Provides wireless connectivity, eliminating the need for cables.
- *Mobility*: Users can move around within the network’s range and remain connected.
- *Flexibility*: Easily scalable and can support a wide range of devices and applications.
- *Cost-Effective*: Lower installation and maintenance costs compared to wired networks.

==== Disadvantages of Wi-Fi
- *Interference*: Wi-Fi signals are prone to interference from other wireless devices, physical obstacles, and even microwave ovens, especially in the 2.4 GHz band.
- *Security Risks*: Without proper encryption (WPA2/WPA3), Wi-Fi networks can be vulnerable to hacking.
- *Performance Degradation*: Speed and signal strength decrease with distance and obstacles. Congested networks with many devices can experience reduced performance.

==== Common Use Cases
- *Home Networking*: Connecting devices like laptops, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices to the internet.
- *Public Wi-Fi*: Providing internet access in public spaces like cafes, airports, and hotels.
- *Office and Enterprise*: Supporting internal networks in workplaces, enabling communication and resource sharing among employees.
- *Mobile Devices*: Wi-Fi provides an alternative to cellular data for mobile devices, allowing high-speed internet access in Wi-Fi zones.
